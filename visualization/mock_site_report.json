/*
This file shows the final output of a mock object which represents the Site Report.
The Site Report will contain many page reports at the end of a crawling session.
It will be represented as a json object to later be processed by Site Report Processor.
The Site Report Processor will spit out something that can be passed to a browser
and visualized in D3.js or something like it...
